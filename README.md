**Tint** (The Italian NLP Tool) is a Java-based pipeline for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Italian.
It is very fast and accurate, and implements most of the common linguistic tools, such as part-of-speech tagging,
dependency parsing, entity linking.
The tool is based on [Stanford CoreNLP](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/), and can be used
as a stand-alone tool, included as a Java library or as a REST API service.
